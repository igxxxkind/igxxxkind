- 👋 Hi, I’m Igor Kindop (@igxxxkind), MSc in Quantitative Economics, pursuing a Ph.D. in Quantitative Economics.
- 👀 I’m interested in macroeconomics, macroeconometrics, and mathematical statistics. In the domain of Macroeconomics, I am fond of Monetary Economics and the inflation phenomenon.
- 🌱 I’m currently participating in the Doctoral Program in Quantitative Economics with a focus on time series. I am working on noncausal autoregressive time series in my dissertation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various econometric and forecasting projects.
- 📫 You can reach me by e-mail (igor.kindop@gmail.com) or by other means of communication.

- This repository is meant to contain some supplementary material for my CV. Thus, I provide some code from the real projects done and upload some toy projects to highlight my econometrics skills.
